# [Assignment 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NOPSS31VhK3m1wPlNjfQJaF2LzBFg1Mv6ji6-1DQa3Y/edit?usp=sharing) (Minigame)
   * **What the assignment was and what I learnt from it** This task was to make a minigame, it was designed to allow students to grasp subparts of game development as a whole, including things like programming, design, planning, documentation and more, this is to let students have more of an insight into game development to allow them to specialise into the subpart of their choice later on. The main skill I learnt from this assignment was planning as it was the skill I most needed to work on.
   
   * **Explain the design Process YEAH I REALLY GOTTA REDO THIS ONE** <a href="url"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e91de4c4-c92e-4002-aee0-31b758b46cf2" align="right" height="240" width="427" ></a> I started by figuring out the main idea for my minigame and ended up choosing the lockpicking minigame from [Starfield](https://bethesda.net/en/game/starfield). I chose to start coding one circle  instead of both at the same time, this came with an issue when coding the second circle, I had to replan the pins spawn conditions entirely.

   * **Constraints for decision making** Due to this minigame being a bit more complex and having randomisation factors involved I had to plan out how the pins would spawn and where the missing pins would be etc...  [This](Pins-Docu.md) is how I planned the pins spawn conditions, I decided to plan this way because I wanted to learn how to use [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) at the time, this allowed me to learn [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) and use it for future projects.
     
   * **How I used these skills** Planning skills are always important no matter the subject, before every task I create a written plan in my notes, it's just simple scrappy notes but it helps me stress less about my workload, here's a really dumbed-down example of what this looks like:

     | Assignment | Issue | Solution and Time |
     | :---: |  :----: | :----: |
     | Game-Dev | Documentation | 1500 words therefore write 250 words a day **Approx 1 hour** |
     | Game-Dev | Item 1 | Finish by Friday **Approx 30 minutes a day** |
     | Game-Dev | Item 2 | Finish by Monday **Approx 15 minutes a day** |
     | Game-Dev | Item 3 | Finish by Wednesday **Approx 20 minutes a day** |
     | Game-Dev | In general | Plan each item out and assign a goal to reach by the end of each day |

   * **How to use these skills in the future** Whenever I plan something I usually plan the main features and leave out the gameplay, this has resulted in not a single game I've made being fun, so from now onwards I will plan the gameplay first but also plan the entirety of the project right at the start, with deadlines and allowing for extra time for safety. In turn, this will improve my workflow and allow me to get straight onto the task instead of planning along the way and working gameplay into it.

   * **If I could redo this assignment** If I could redo this assignment I would plan out the entire assignment right at the beginning before I even touched any game development tools, this would have saved me countless hours of issues that revolved around planning the pins and coding the circles and even more. Planning was something I lacked whilst making this assignment but it is also something that this assignment taught me.

# [Assignment 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oKG_SgVptfr3FlIjtfTagEakSAonJlZFscl0Sa1Ja-Q/edit?usp=sharing) (Save States)
   * **What the assignment was and what I learnt from it** This assignment was designed to teach students how to make save states, however, this assignment didn't only teach me how to make save states but also almost every part of a game, I had to create the UI, Art, Sound, Gameplay and more, and this taught me a lot about making games and improved my workflow for future work. But I had an issue, I wasted too much time making the main feature (Saving) and by the time I had made a [Saving System](save_controller.gd) I had nothing to save with it which defeated the whole purpose of making it.
     
   * **How I used these skills** Unfortunately I didn't learn from my main mistake with this assignment. When making [Assignment 4](#Assignment-4) I started with the [Dialogue System](Dialogue.gd) which was the main feature, however, this system took me so long that I had very little time to make the gameplay fun, interactive and intuitive. This issue is my biggest flaw as of current and has affected all of my work, whether its personal or school work.
     
   * **Explain the design Process** Learning from [Assignment 2 (Minigame)](#Assignment-2), my design process started with planning, however as previously mentioned I did not fully plan from start to finish which became a big issue. After needing improvement planning I got to work on the project, coding the saving system and AI for enemies, etc.. In class I had multiple students test my project and give feedback, as a developer it hurt to hear what I thought was good be criticized but it was necessary to take the game to the next level, I then applied that feedback and finalized the project with a few small iterations.
     
   * **Constraints for decision making** <a href="url"><img src="failed-shop.png" align="right" height="240" width="427" ></a> The main constraint that I had whilst making this project was 'Time', I did not realise that my project was too ambitious until it was too late. This image shows the shop that I tried to implement into the game but quickly ran out of time and had to completely scrap. **Come back to this**
     
   * **How to use these skills in the future** Saving is a key part of a lot of games, it allows the player to not risk losing all their progress at once and lets the player explore varying options throughout the game risk-free, this encourages player choice and increases player enjoyment. Now that I have made a saving system I understand the fundamentals and can apply this knowledge to future projects to allow them to save as well.
     
   * **If I could redo this assignment** Just like how I would redo [Assignment 2 (Minigame)](#Assignment-2), I would also cater more time into the documentation of this assignment, A key issue I found with all my documentation up until this point is not asking 'Why', Reading [this](snippet.md) it is very clear that I am just writing exactly what I did, here is a rough example of how I would have rewrote [that](new-snippet.md), this is much more telling, it gives more information to the reader and doesn't explain each line of the code directly. After I write all my documentation I re-read it and ask myself "Why?" if I haven't explained something, then I write the 'Why'.

# Ethics and Sustainability
   * Players are the most vital part of game development, and listening to them is the key to a good game. It is important to respect players and get consent for everything that might infringe on their privacy, this is an ethical consideration that a lot of games in the industry do not take into consideration and instead, they take the players' data and sell it to third party sources.
     
   * A major advantage of game development is the wide audience it reaches as developers can use this audience to share their stories and spread enjoyment to a large sum of people, however with this comes some drawbacks, companies/individuals that don't respect players can use this platform to spread harmful information and can also change the way players' act outside of the game, this is why some studies show that games can increase violence in players'.
     
   * It is crucial that all games follow a strict ethical code to ensure the safety of players, **(Integrity)** The act of being honest and having strong moral principles, **(Transparency)** The act of being as clear as possible to the players' to ensure no miscommunication or hidden secrets, **(Respect for playersâ€™ rights and autonomy)** The act of respecting a players's right and understanding that players' are autonomous and can't be controlled.
   
   * **Write about the current state of game dev and why the layoffs**
