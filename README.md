# Assignment 1 (Pizza Ordering System)
   * **Write about the read and writing to files**
     
   * My first assignment was to make a pizza ordering system, this assignment taught me some basic programming skills, and I gained some new skills around "for loops", "lists" and reading/writing to files which helped me throughout some of my future assignments as "for loops" and "lists" are vital building blocks in code, here I used a "for loop" to iterate through a text file for my dialogue system in my fourth assignment **(Insert code here)**. The
     
   * Looking back on my code for this assignment, I learnt some crucial skills around modular coding. When making this assignment I had a lot of bugs and overall issues editing the code and adding on to it, every single line was tangled amongst other lines, which is what most developers call "spaghetti code", thanks to this assignment, it allowed me to learn how I failed and how to fix my mistakes, now all my functions are modular, rather than having a lot of functions like this one **(insert function here)**, I could have made a single master function like this one **(Insert better function here)** and just used the arguments to control the functions, this is what I currently do for all my code and without this assignment, I wouldn't have developed this understanding until later down the line.
     
   * This assignment was designed to let students fail in order to learn and develop their understanding of programming, skills gained from this assignment were used in all my future assignments, for example, here's the code for my top-down movement script in my third assignment **(insert code)**, it's clear that this code is modular and there is no "spaghetti code" which demonstrates my application of learning from this assignment.
  
   * Skills learnt from this assignment can be used in the future by adapting the functions learnt from this assignment to future situations, an example of this would be using a "for loop" **Consider deleting assignment 1**

# Assignment 2 (Minigame)
   * This task was to make a minigame, it was designed to allow students to grasp subparts of game development as a whole, including things like programming, design, planning, documentation and more, this is to let students have more of an insight into game development to allow them to specialise into the subpart of their choice later on. The main skill I learnt from this assignment was planning, due to this minigame being a bit more complex and having randomisation factors involved I had to plan out how the pins would spawn and where the missing pins would be etc... **(Insert the pin image here)** This image may not look like much but this is how I planned the pins spawn conditions [Documentation on this assignment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NOPSS31VhK3m1wPlNjfQJaF2LzBFg1Mv6ji6-1DQa3Y/edit?usp=sharing), I decided to plan this way because I wanted to learn how to use [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) at the time, this allowed me to learn [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) and use it for future projects.
     
   * Planning skills are always important no matter the subject, before every task I create a written plan in my notes, it's just simple scrappy notes but it helps me stress less about my workload, here's a really dumbed-down example of what this looks like:

     | Assignment | Issue | Solution and Time |
     | :---: |  :----: | :----: |
     | Game-Dev | Documentation | 1500 words therefore write 250 words a day **Approx 1 hour** |
     | Game-Dev | Item 1 | Finish by Friday **Approx 30 minutes a day** |
     | Game-Dev | Item 2 | Finish by Monday **Approx 15 minutes a day** |
     | Game-Dev | Item 3 | Finish by Wednesday **Approx 20 minutes a day** |
     | Game-Dev | In general | Plan each item out and assign a goal to reach by the end of each day |

# Assignment 3 (Save States)
   * This assignment was designed to teach students how to make save states, however, this assignment didn't only teach me how to make save states but also almost every part of a game, I had to create the UI, Art, Sound, Gameplay and more, and this taught me a lot about making games and improved my workflow for future work. But I had an issue, rather than wasting a lot of time on sub-features I instead needed to code the main gameplay loop first, the reason is that I had made a [Saving System](save_controller.gd) however I had nothing to save with it which defeated the whole purpose of making it.
     
   * Unfortunately I didn't learn from my mistake with this assignment alone. When making [Assignment 4](#Assignment-4) I started with the [Dialogue System](Dialogue.gd) which is a main feature, however, this system took me so long that I had very little time to make the gameplay fun, interactive and intuitive. This issue is my biggest flaw as of current and has affected all of my work, whether its personal or school work.

# Ethics and Sustainability
   * Players are the most vital part of game development, and listening to them is the key to a good game. It is important to respect players and get consent for everything that might infringe on their privacy, this is an ethical consideration that a lot of games in the industry do not take into consideration and instead, they take the players' data and sell it to third party sources.
     
   * A major advantage of game development is the wide audience it reaches as developers can use this audience to share their stories and spread enjoyment to a large sum of people, however with this comes some drawbacks, companies/individuals that don't respect players can use this platform to spread harmful information and can also change the way players' act outside of the game, this is why some studies show that games can increase violence in players'.
     
   * It is crucial that all games follow a strict ethical code to ensure the safety of players, **(Integrity)** The act of being honest and having strong moral principles, **(Transparency)** The act of being as clear as possible to the players' to ensure no miscommunication or hidden secrets, **(Respect for playersâ€™ rights and autonomy)** The act of respecting a players's right and understanding that players' are autonomous and can't be controlled.
