# DT2_Assignment_2
   * Explain the design process:
   * Contraints and implications for decision making:
   * Explains technology theories, concepts and principles and describes the properties of materials or data or systems to address a need, problem, or challenge:
   * Thinks critically, drawing on data and information to solve problems:
*The unit was designed to allow students to fail, so that they can learn and improve their problem solving
The unit is designed to be more general so that skills can transfer
Make the document interesting and fancy (For better grades)
Write about the ethics (Why open source)
Write about the current state of game dev and why the layoffs
Write about the understanding gained and how it was/can be applied to future learning/assignments

1. DT1_Assignment_1:
   * My first assignment was to make a pizza ordering system, this assignment taught me some basic programming skills, and I gained some new skills around "for loops" and "lists" which helped me throughout all my future assignments.
   * Looking back on my code for this assignment, I can see that I learnt some crucial skills around modular coding. When making this assignment I had a lot of bugs and overall issues editing the code and adding on to it, every single line was tangled amongst other lines, which is what most developers call "spaghetti code", thanks to this assignment, it allowed me to learn how I failed and how to fix my mistakes, now all my functions are modular, rather than having a lot of functions like this one **(insert function here)**, I could have made a single master function like this one **(Insert better function here)** and just used the arguments to control the functions, this is what I currently do for all my code and without this assignment, I wouldn't have developed this understanding until later down the line.
   * Overall this assignment was designed to let students fail in order to learn and develop their understanding of programming,
   
3. DT1_Assignment_2:
   * This task was to make a minigame, it was designed to allow students to grasp subparts of game development as a whole including things like programming, design, planning, documentation and more, this is to let students have more of an insite into game development to allow them to specialise into the subpart of their choice later on
